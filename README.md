SETTING UP
Open the "yalies" folder in VSCode. The virtual environment will need to be activated. Although this depends on where the file is saved, executing "source /Applications/yalies/venv/bin/activate" worked for us. Then cd into "venv." To view the website, execute "flask run." It is possible that flask will need to be installed via https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/ or that the FLASK_APP environment variable will need to be exported, instructions via https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/ if it does not automatically work. Upon running "flask run," click the link to access our project.

HOME PAGE
Upon opening the website, you will be taken to the homepage, which displays featured restaurants. For the main featured restaurant, click on the image to be taken to the restaurant's website. For the secondary featured websites, simply click the name of the restaurant to be taken to the website. From the home page, you can navigate to any other page--explore, can't choose, or request--via the navigation bar.

EXPLORE
The explore page will automatically display all restaurants that have been added to the website. You can scroll to explore these. Within each restaurant card are a number of links as well as other important information. Clicking "view full menu," will take you to the restaurant's menu as reported on their website. Clicking "pickup" or "delivery" will take you to a wesbite to order food from the restaurant for pickup or delivery, respectively. Clicking "visit website" will take you to the homepage of the restaurant's website. There is also a search bar on the top of this page, which can be used to search by restaurant name. For example, typing "McDonald's," "mcdonald's," or "mc" and clicking enter or the "search button" will display the card of information for McDonald's. If a restaurant cannot be found based on the information entered in the search bar, an error page will appear.

CAN'T CHOOSE?
The can't choose? page is a random restaurant generator. Reloading the page will return information for one of the restaurant's included on our website. Clicking "view full menu" will take you to the restaurant's menu as reported on their website. Clicking "pickup" or "delivery" will take you to a wesbite to order food from the restaurant for pickup or delivery, respectively. Clicking "visit website" will take you to the homepage of the restaurant's website. 

REQUEST
The request page allows you to request a restaurant be added to our website. After typing the restaurant you would like to be added and clicking the request button, you will be taken to a page to confirm your submission. Check the "I am not a robot" box to submit your request. You should see a page that says your form was successfully submitted. Click the link under this to return to the homepage of our website.
